I got this feeling on the summer day
When you were gone

I crashed my car into the bridge
I watched, I let it burn

I threw your shit into a bag
And pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the brigde

I don't care! I love it!
I don't care!

You're on a different road
I'm in the Milky Way
You want me down on earth
But I'm up in space

You're so damn hard to please
We got to kill this switch
You're from the 70-ies
But I'm a 90-ies bitch

I love it! I love it!
